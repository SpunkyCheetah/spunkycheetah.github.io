            <h1>What is MCYT?</h1>
            <p><strong>Minecraft YouTube (MCYT)</strong> is, at the most basic level, YouTube videos and creators that focus on Minecraft Gameplay, and the communites and fandoms surrounding them. For the context of this website the only part of MCYT you really need to know about is SMPs (Survival Multi-Player, a kind of server) and the (often improv) role-playing that sometimes comes with them (and less frequntly other genres of MCYT).</p>
            <p>The SMPs that I am most familiar with are Hermitcraft, Life Series, and Dream SMP, though I am also somewhat familiar with Empires SMP, QSMP, and a few others.</p>

            <div id="mcyt-details">
                <h1>More about these SMPs</h1>
                <p><strong>Hermitcraft</strong> (HC) is one of the less role-play centric SMPs, with little-to-no overarching lore. Hermitcraft is more known for beautiful builds and impressive redstone mchanisms, along with their shopping districts, prank wars, and the general social nature, prank wars, and hermits helping hermits. That said, even Hermitcraft has its fair share of (usually one-off) storylines and worldbuilding that pops up throughout the seasons, and the fandoms often carries over lore and story elements from other SMPs the members have been on as well. You can check it out at the official site, <a href="https://hermitcraft.com/"> Hermitcraft.com</a>, or by going to any member's channel and just picking a season to start on.</p>
                <p><strong>Life Series</strong> (also known amongst its fans as Traffic SMP) is a psuedo-hardcore series in which each player has three lives, Green, Yellow, and Red. They start out peaceful, but once players turn Red they become hostile and attempt to get every other player down to Red as well. It ultimately playes out as sort of Death Game with the last person standing being the winner, which leads to a lot of improv role-playing and story developing natrually as team-ups form and betrayals happen. If you want to watch it you can start at the beginning of any season from any POV, with Grian's Third Life and Pearlescentmoon's Double Life being some of the most iconic and my personal recommendations.</p>
                <p><strong>Dream SMP</strong> (DSMP) is a very lore centric SMP, though a bit more complicated to get into, as it was live streamed on Twitch, rather than released in pre-recorded and fully edited YouTube videos. There are hours and hours of content from every member and not all of it is lore related, or even properly saved and archived anywhere on the internet. To get caught up on the lore I would honestly recommend a fandom-first approach, getting the gist of the storyline through fan-made animatics and songs before diving deeper. Aside from that BlueBerryTV is a good channel to start on, where you can watch edited episodes of the various events from multiple POVs pretty easily (though it hasn't covered the entire storyline yet and is still in progress). Besides that, pick some specific events and creators and track down the VODs for them. DSMP was immensely popular, so many VODs can be found re-uploaded on YouTube VOD channels.</p>
