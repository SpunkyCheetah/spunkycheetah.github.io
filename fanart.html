                        <img src="images/colored/dsmp-niki-upsidedown.png" alt="A linelss digital art drawing of Niki hanging upside down, cut off at her chest. She has pink hair with brown streaks to either side of her face and lynx ears - one of which has an emerald earring hanging from it. The background is a patch of sky surrounded by leaves, implying that she is hanging from a tree." class="thin-image">
                        <p>This was based off of a sketch I'd doodled while camping when I first made my DSMP Niki design. I thought it looked good, so I re-did it digitally!</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <img src="images/colored/dsmp-micheal-and-butterfly.png" alt="A lineless digital art drawing of Michael Underscore Beloved, a zombie piglin child, laying in a grassy field and reaching for a butterfly. He is wearing a stripes yellow and brown sweater and teal overalls." class="wide-image">
                        <p>One of a few drawings I did of Michael Underscore Beloved of DSMP around this time.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <img src="images/colored/dsmp-niki-and-techno.png" alt="A lineless digital art drawing of Niki and Technoblade standing back-to-back, Niki is weilding a netherite sword." class="thin-image">
                        <p>One of many drawings I did as an art request for someone on Tumblr. Also the first time I drew Niki, if I remember correctly.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <img src="images/colored/dsmp-peerpressureduo-naptime.png" alt="A lineless digital art drawing of Ranboo and Technoblade sitting huddled up together in the tundra. Ranboo is bundled up in a purple cloak and potentially asleep, leaning on Techno with one of Techno's arms around them." class="wide-image">
                        <p>Another drawing I did as a sketch first, that both I and Tumblr really liked so I re-did it digitally.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <img src="images/colored/dsmp-unfinished-symphony.png" alt="A digital art drawing of Wilbur with an explosion filling the background. His arms are lifted and his head is angled down so that his eyes are in shadow. He is shouting and weeping." class="wide-image">
                        <p>"MY L'MANBURG PHIL! My Unfinished Symphony: Forever Unfinished! If I can't have it no one can, Phil." - Wilbur Soot's words as he destroyed L'Manburg in DSMP.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <img src="images/colored/dsmp-philza.png" alt="A linelss digital art drawing of Philza on a black background with a glowing green outline. He is in a crouching position with his wings spread as if he has just landed, though one of his wings is torn and burnt" class="wide-image">
                        <p>Just Philza of DSMP looking cool.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <img src="images/colored/dsmp-burger-van-duo.png" alt="A top down digital art drawing of Ranboo and Wilbur laying in the grass facing the sky and surrounded by small flowers. Ranboo is in the bottom left corner with their eyes wide open and Wilbur is in the top right seemingly asleep." class="thin-image">
                        <p>This fanart was the result of listening to songs that made me think of Ranboo and Wilbur and the Hitting On 16 arc of DSMP for too long. Namely the lines "though it feel like we were built // from the same dirt" from <em>You Sister Was Right</em> by Wilbur Soot.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <img src="images/colored/dsmp-tommy-blink.png" alt="A lineless digital art drawing of Tommy shoulders-up, mid-blink with his eyes closed. He has floppy elf-like ears pointed downwards and a white streak in his hair, and is wearing a green bandana around his neck and a blue jacket or cardigen." class="thin-image">
                        <p>Some of my mutuals and mutual-in-laws on tumblr were quite enjoying collecting screenshots of Tommy from DSMP blinking because he has a very cute blinking face, so I decided to join in with my own rendition of the pose.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <img src="images/colored/dsmp-ranboo-crown-rectangle.png" alt="A lineless digital art drawing of Ranboo with a dark purple background with light eminating from the center. He is staring at his paper crown, between his hands at the center of the image." class="wide-image">
                        <p>I actually sketched this up months before I finished it, and then just forgot it existed for ages before finally working on it again.</p>
                    </li>

                        <img src="images/sketches/hc-grian-wings.png" alt="A digital art drawing of Grian, with his back to the camera. He has one wing spread to display the red-yellow-blue coloring. He also has a blue and red feathered tail, red and yellow feathered ears, and taloned legs." class="thin-image">
                        <p>A colored sketch I did of Grian from Hermitcraft to figure out how to correctly draw his avian features, basing them on scarlet macaw coloring.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <img src="images/sketches/hc-avian-mumbo-sketch.png" alt="A digital art drawing of Mumbo Jumbo, with his back to the camera and looking over his shoulder. He has red-tipped black wings folded to his sides." class="thin-image">
                        <p>Mumbo Jumbo from Hermitcraft, but with wings because wings are fun.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <img src="images/sketches/hc-winged-mumbo-doodles.png" alt="Four Digital art sketches of Mumbo with wings. Two of them are larger: a shoulders-up sketch with his wings framing him, and a side-view with very small wings and down on his cheeks and ears. The other two are smaller: a tiny Mumbo napping in a pile of Grian's sweaters, and a tiny Mumbo flapping his wings and pumping his fists in frustration." class="thin-image">
                        <p>I have a lot of drawings of avian!Mumbo.</p>

                        <img src="images/sketches/dsmp-ranboo-with-cane.png" alt="Three digital art sketches of Ranboo using a cane. The drawing on the left is a full-body sketch of him standing and leaning on the cane, one of his feet is a prosthetic. The top right is in a more cute and stylized sketch with no prosthetic. The bottom right is a soulders-up sketch of him but this time holding the cane at an angle and with an arrow saying 'blind'" class="thin-image">
                        <p>Someone on Tumblr gave me an art request for Ranboo using a cane, so here are the resulting sketches! I tried to experiment with some different reasons for needing a cane since the original requester didn't clarify, so I did one Ranboo with a posthetic, one blind Ranboo, and another Ranboo with a more invisible disability (like chronic pain for example).</p>

                        <img src="images/sketches/dsmp-dadboo-with-wheelchair.png" alt="A digital art sketch of Ranboo sitting in a wheelchair facing the camera with his son Michael on his lap. The wheelchair is split down the middle half white and half black." class="thin-image">
                        <p>After coming up with the Ranboo ambulatory wheelchair user headcanon I just really wanted to draw him with Michael in his lap.</p>

                            <img src="images/sketches/hc-yawn-hug-2.png" alt="The second panel of the previous image, Grian is now stretching with his arms up and out and his wings spread, with the text 'yawwn...' above him.">
                            <img src="images/sketches/hc-yawn-hug-3.png" alt="The third panel of the previous images, Scar has appeared and is hugging Grian. Grian has a blank surprised expression and there is text saying 'hug!' to the side">
                            <img src="images/sketches/hc-yawn-hug-4.png" alt="The final panel of the previous images, soomed in on on Grian's baffled face while Scar continues to hug him, unaware of the confusion.">
                        </div>
                        <p>Got this idea from someone on Tumblr, who commented in the notes on one of my posts that my animation of Grian yawning/stretching kind of looking like he was reaching out for a hug.</p>

                    <li>
                        <img src="images/sketches/dsmp-promiseduo-rain.png" alt="A digital art sketch of Ranboo and Philza sitting in the grass in the rain. Philza has a wing over Ranboo to shield him from the rain, and Ranboo is curled up to fit under it with his arms wrapped around his legs." class="thin-image">
                        <p>This drawing and the following are sort of sibling doodles of each other, with Phil and Techno just making sure Ranboo doesn't get dissolved by the rain.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <img src="images/sketches/dsmp-peerpressureduo-rain.png" alt="A digital art sketch of Ranboo and Technoblade in the rain trying to fit Ranboo under Techno's cloak so he doesn't get wet, both are laughing." class="thin-image">
                        <p>The sort of sibling piece to the previous sketch, but with Technoblade instead of Philza.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <img src="images/sketches/dsmp-young-human-techno.png" alt="A shoulders-up digital art sketch of Technoblade, he is younger and has a mostly human appearance." class="thin-image">
                        <p>I usually draw Technoblade as very much just an anthropomorphic pig/boar guy, but this is one of the times I've dabbled in human-adjacent Techno. He's also a bunch younger, too.</p>
