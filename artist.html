            <p>Hello, I'm Loki (they/them or any pronouns), the person who made this website and all the fanart on it!</p>
            <p>I am queer dual-enrollment college and high school technical program student who grew up homeschooled. I am studying video game development, programming, and art, as well as taking a web design class currently (hence this website!). I spend a lot of my free-time with fandom related stuff, specifically MCYT at the moment, and one of my main hobbies is drawing.</p>
            <p>I have been making fanart for as long as I can remember, having spent a lot of my childhood making up OC creatues for Pokemon and Lilo & Stitch, or making comics and other art for Avatar: The Last Airbender, My Little Pony, Ninjago, and basically any other show, game, or book I knew of.</p>

            <div id="minecraft-sona">
                <p>I also have a Minecraft sona/OC that I use for my own Minecraft-related playing and role-playing: c!Loki.</p>

                    <img src="images/colored/wl-cloki.png" alt="A digital lineless art of a cute bidepal creature with large green eyes and paw pads, and light grey fur with a few pale speckles. It has a long tail with a tuft of fur at the end, big floppy ears, stubby horns on the top of its head with a flower on one, and exaggerated porpotions. It is wearing a brown vest and black shorts.">

                    <img src="images/colored/gsmp-cloki-ref.png" alt="Another digital lineless art of the same creature, but this time with cyan eyes and paw pads, and dark purple fur. It is wearing a lilac shirt, teal overalls, and flower crown.">

                <p>Their design varies somewhat across different things I use them for, but the basic idea generally carries over.</p>

                    <img src="images/colored/gsmp-fall-duo.png" alt="A digital art drawing of two characters falling, reaching out to grab each other's hands. One is the same creature as before - specifically the purple version wearing the overalls - and the other is a character with light purple skin, short green hair, pointed ears, fairy wings, and pure white eyes, wearing an off-white sweater and ripped jeans.">
